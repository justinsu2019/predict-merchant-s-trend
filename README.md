# predict-merchant-s-trend

# finally, we will need to be able to :
## classify merchants by: life cycle(just onboarded / old fellow) / industry / 

## predict merchants' next month TPV by their classes
### create a DNN for every circumstance,
#### only need user to guide on which columns are the labels, default the last column is the label
##### they can select on the label instead of input it.


## can tell which is a good trend of merchants
### provide the trend of merchants 
#### most likely to be a linear regression question
### calculate regression and tell the coefficient of it then compair it with level average growth rate to see if it's better.


## take out the outlier of the TPV/RRR/ASP for each merchant
### mark if it's a good one or a bad one
